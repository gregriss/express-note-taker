  In order to run this application, you must have node.js installed. From there, you can initialize Node Package Manager using the command `npm init -y` in the terminal. Then, you need to install express.js using the command `npm install express --save`. You should have then have a package.json file which includes express under dependencies. From there, the app should function correctly provided that you have a functioning server.

  ## Usage
